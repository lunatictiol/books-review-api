## API Testing with Postman

A Postman collection for all API endpoints is included in the repo as [`postman_collection.json`](./github-files/postman_collection.json).  

You can import this file into Postman to easily test all API routes with predefined requests and example data.  

To import:  
1. Open Postman  
2. Click on **Import**  
3. Select the `postman_collection.json` file from the repo  
4. Start sending requests!
